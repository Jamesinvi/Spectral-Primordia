# Spectral
Spectral is a completely custom SRP for Unity.
# Primordia
Primordia is an experimental echosystem/life planet simulation game, that uses Unity and Spectral as rendering engines.
It uses a custom ECS built to be extremely easy to understand even if it's currently not optimal.
### All of this is experimental !!
