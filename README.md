# Spectral
Spectral is a completely custom SRP for Unity.
# Autonation
Autonation is an experimental automation/resource management game, that uses Unity and Spectral as rendering engines.
It uses a custom ECS built to be extremely easy to understand even if it's currently not optimal.
### All of this is experimental !!
